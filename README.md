# Segment_Anything_Model
Use the segmentAnythingModel object and its object functions to interactively segment objects in an image using visual prompts.  A segmentAnythingModel object configures a pretrained Segment Anything Model (SAM) for semantic segmentation of objects in an image without retraining the model.
