# Segment_Anything_Model
Use the segmentAnythingModel object and its object functions to interactively segment objects in an image using visual prompts.  A segmentAnythingModel object configures a pretrained Segment Anything Model (SAM) for semantic segmentation of objects in an image without retraining the model.
Since the model of this is very big so you can download it from the gpt name "sam_vit_h_4b8939.pth".
After type "streamlit run segmenation_interactive.pyto" run this program.
After add points and then see the semented image.
